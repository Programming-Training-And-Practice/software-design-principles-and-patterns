## Documentation.





## Creational Design Patterns.
* Abstract Factory (or Factory or Kit).
* Factory Method (or Virtual Constructor).
* Builder.
  * Uses cases: 
    * Constructor have many parameters. 
    * Class have mandatory and some optional parameters.
  * Pros:
    * We can set just the properties we need and the build method can handle defaults. 
  * Cons:
    * It does create more code and could introduce more complexity.
  * Best practice:
    * Builder() constructor should receive as a parameter of the constructor instance of the class that build. Example `public Builder(ObjectThatBuild object)`
* Prototype.
* Singleton.
